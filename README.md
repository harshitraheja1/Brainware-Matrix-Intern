**Data Preparation and Cleaning**
1. **Transaction Data Examination**
The transaction dataset was reviewed to identify and address:
•	Inconsistencies: Ensuring correct identification of product categories and alignment with expected attributes.
•	Missing Data: Addressing gaps in numerical and categorical fields to maintain dataset integrity.
•	Outliers: Analyzing and handling unusual data points that could skew the results.
•	Category Validation: Verifying product categorization to avoid misclassification of items.
2. Customer Data Examination
Similarly, the customer dataset was evaluated for:
•	Null Values: Identifying and resolving missing entries to ensure the completeness of customer profiles.
•	Anomalies: Rectifying inconsistencies in customer attributes, such as demographic or behavioral data.
Once both datasets were cleaned, they were merged to form a comprehensive dataset for subsequent analysis. This integrated dataset provides a holistic view of customer transactions and their associated attributes.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Metrics Definition and Analysis
To understand purchasing behavior, we analyzed the following key metrics:
•	Total Sales: Quantifying overall revenue generated by chip sales.
•	Sales Drivers: Identifying factors influencing high sales, such as product types, promotional strategies, or seasonal trends.
•	Top Sales Sources: Highlighting locations, customer segments, or time periods contributing the most to revenue.
**Data Exploration and Visualizations**
EDA was conducted using various statistical techniques and visual tools. Key steps included:
•	Generating charts and graphs to visualize trends, such as total sales by time, customer segment, or region.
•	Identifying trends in purchasing behavior, such as frequency of purchases or average transaction values for different customer groups.
•	Highlighting insights such as demographic preferences, popular product sizes, or high-performing store locations.

Based on the analysis, we identified:
1.	Behavioral Patterns: Key trends in customer purchase behavior, including preferences for certain product sizes or brands.
2.	Segment-Specific Insights: Differences in purchasing patterns across demographic groups or loyalty tiers.
3.	Sales Optimization Opportunities: Strategies to capitalize on identified patterns, such as tailored promotions or inventory adjustments.

**Conclusion**
After all our preliminary analysis done above, we might be able to conclude(as for now), that
•	more focus should be given to the Mainstream customers, specifically the YOUNG SINGLES and COUPLES. This can be also followed by the OLD customers, specifically the RETIREES.
•	Sales are highest for Budget, OLDER FAMILIES; Mainstream, YOUNG SINGLES/COUPLES and Mainstream, RETIREES
•	Mainstream, YOUNG SINGLES/COUPLES are more likely to pay more per packet of chips than their premium and budget counterparts
•	They are also more likely to purchase 'Tyrrells'/'Twisties' and '270g' pack sizes than the rest of the population
